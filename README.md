This project implements a two-layer feedforward neural network from scratch using only NumPy to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset.
Unlike libraries such as TensorFlow or PyTorch, every step — from weight initialization to forward propagation, backpropagation, and parameter updates — is coded manually.
This makes the project a great educational resource for understanding the mathematical foundations of deep learning.
